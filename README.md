<br>
This is the widget tree for the xylophone app in which it uses the key class to reuse the multiple keys used in the xylophone.

This widget tree is for the key class in which expanded widget is returned so that it will expand until the end of screen of the device used.

All in all, the Expanded key class proves useful in reusing elements that can be used again in the app especially in this app.
